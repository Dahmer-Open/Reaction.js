# Reaction
Reaction aims to simplify emoji usage in react applications. It includes an emoji selector and (*if there's interest in the project*) reactions tags and a plug-and-play emoji suggestion box for text inputs.

## Getting Started

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Dahmer-Open/Reaction.js.git`;
2. Install dependencies, in the root directory, run `npm i`;
3. Start the project `npm start`.

## Roadmap

The roadmap below details a bunch of feature that will be implemented in Reaction.
I will continue developing it in my spare time, but if we reach the given star milestones, I'll implement them right away as I consider that there's enough interest in the project for it to move forward.
